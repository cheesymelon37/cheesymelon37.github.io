    <td>Although the beginning of the lesson was just admin, we moved on to start our topic of google sheets. We were asked what a certain jumble of letters said. We then had to figure out what it said, because it was in code. It turned out to say 'hello world'. Next lesson we will be challenged with the task of trying to get google sheets to write it in code.</td>

    <td>There wasnâ€™t much to reflect on this week since it was mostly admin. But some things slipped my mind when I started to write this blog, so I will listen more carefully and be sure to try and remember all of the names and techniques for doing these things that he shows me.</td>
